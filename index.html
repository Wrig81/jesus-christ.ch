                    The crucifixion was in 1st line torture and only in 2nd line an execution. 
                    In ancient Rome, it was mainly non-Romans (slaves and rebels) who were crucified. It was considered a deterrent method. <br> <br>

            What do we really know about Jesus? Today, scientific research by ancient historians, archaeologists and theologians paints an increasingly 
            precise picture of the founder of Christianity.
          </p> 
           <br> 
          <p>
            Jesus was born in the years 8 to 6 before Christ. The latest date must be the year 4 before Christ, when King Herod died. Bethlehem is mentioned 
            as the place of birth. Jesus practiced the trade of his father, the carpenter profession. His mother tongue was Aramaic. He grew up entirely in the 
            faith and piety of a Jew. In the year 27/28 John the Baptist came to the public, called for baptism by bus in the Jordan. Jesus was baptized by him 
            and began to appear as an itinerant preacher himself. He did not withdraw ascetically into the desert like John, but sought out the people in the towns 
            and villages, among which Capernaum on the Sea of Galilee stands out especially.

            Ethically, he represented a strictly God-centered ethos of the pure heart, breaking through any moral rigidity, by deepening the demands of the Old Testament. 
            The center of his speech and action was his understanding of God: God as the philanthropic, loving Father who places mercy above justice and who loves people 
            beyond sin and death. Jesus did signs and wonders. He healed the sick, cast out demons and had fellowship with people who were on the fringes of society.

        <p>In the manner of Jewish rabbis, he gathered around him a circle of disciples, without being a studied specialist theologian,
           whom, unlike the Jewish teachers, he did not so much instruct in the interpretation of Scripture s bind to his person and teachings 
           and send out to spread his message among the Jewish people, especially in Galilee. </p> <br>
          
        <p>  His public ministry was increasingly marked by disputes with the scribes and Pharisees, who accused him of blasphemous presumption, heresy, 
          disloyalty to the law, and seduction of the people. At the Passover, probably in the year 30, the conflict in Jerusalem came to a dramatic head. 
          Jesus, knowing of his arrest, celebrated a farewell feast with his disciples. Shortly thereafter, through the treachery of his disciple Judas Iscariot, 
          his arrest by the Roman occupation forces took place, with the Jewish leaders under the high priest Caiphas accusing him of being an insurrectionist and 
          political rebel. He was sentenced to crucifixion by the procurator Pontius Pilate and executed on April 7 in the year 30.
